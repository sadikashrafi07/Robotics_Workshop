# Robotics Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Robotics Workshop, a two-day intensive program where participants delved into the realm of robotics using Arduino Uno. Throughout the workshop, attendees gained hands-on experience in coding and building various robotic projects. Here, you will find the codes and resources for the four projects developed during the workshop:

## Projects

1. **Obstacle Avoidance Robot**
   - **Description**: This robot is equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in its path and navigate around them autonomously.
   - **Code**: The code for implementing obstacle avoidance behavior in the robot.

2. **Line Follower Robot**
   - **Description**: The line follower robot, equipped with IR sensors, is programmed to follow a predefined path marked by a contrasting line on the ground.
   - **Code**: Implementation of algorithms enabling the robot to track and follow the line accurately.

3. **Bluetooth Controlled Robot**
   - **Description**: This robot can be controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth using a smartphone or other compatible devices.
   - **Code**: Scripts for establishing Bluetooth communication and controlling the robot's movements.

4. **Human Follower Robot**
   - **Description**: An advanced project where the robot uses IR and ultrasonic sensors to detect and follow a human operator within its vicinity.
   - **Code**: Algorithms for tracking and following human movement, along with safety measures.
